Cryer (PG): Questionable, hamstring strain[1][2][3]\n- Jimmy Butler III (SF/PF): Out, torn right ACL (season-ending)[1][2][3]\n- Kristaps Porzingis (C/PF): Out, Achilles issue[1][2][3]\n- Brandin Podziemski (PG/SG): Probable, illness[1][2][3]\n\n**Los Angeles Lakers:**\n- Luka Doncic (PG/SF): Out, hamstring strain[1][2][3]\n- Adou Thiero (SF/SG): Out, right knee/MCL sprain[1][2]\n- Luke Kennard (SG): Probable, illness (pending trade noted earlier)[1][2]\n- Jaxson Hayes (C): Questionable, suspension[2]\n\n### Betting Lines\nLakers favored by 2.5 points; projected total between 222.5 and 223.5[1]. No moneyline odds available.\n\n### Line Movement\nNo information on opening lines or notable moves.\n\n### Recent News\nLakers defeated Warriors 105-99 on February 7, 2026, without Curry and Doncic; Austin Reaves limited, LeBron James, Rui Hachimura active[4]. Game on February 8 ongoing or recently started, with players like Moses Moody, Draymond Green, LeBron James, Jaxson Hayes, Brandin Podziemski participating[5]. Lakers' Deandre Ayton available per official report[6]. Warriors lead season series 1-0 prior to February 7 loss[1].\n\n### Additional Context\n### Stephen Curry Injury Status\nStephen Curry is listed as **Out** for the Warriors @ Lakers game on February 7, 2026, due to right patellofemoral pain syndrome (runner's knee).[1][2]  \nHe has missed at least two prior games and is not expected to return before February 9, with the team classifying it as day-to-day rather than structural.[1][2]  \nCurry described it as \"trending in the right direction\" but still painful, requiring rehab to reduce inflammation; his absence removes the Warriors' primary scorer (all-time leading scorer) and floor leader, forcing reliance on Draymond Green, Moses Moody, Al Horford, and Quinten Post for offense, which impacts efficiency against a Lakers defense that can target secondary creators.[1][2]\n\n### Warriors Roster Changes and Injuries\nKristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is was acquired by the Warriors from the Atlanta Hawks via trade on Thursday (February 5, 2026), but is **Out** with left Achilles-tendon issue and has not played since January 7.[1][2][3]  \nThis reduces interior presence and scoring, compounding rotation challenges; Warriors dealt Buddy Hield and Jonathan Kuminga in the trade.[3]  \nOther absences: Seth Curry (Out, left sciatic-nerve irritation), L.J. Cryer (Out, hamstring strain), Brandin Podziemski (Probable/day-to-day, illness).[1]  \nWarriors enter at 28-24 (eighth in West), shorthanded amid a 3-5 stretch in last eight games post-Jimmy Butler's season-ending ACL tear on January 19.[1][3]\n\n### Lakers Roster Composition\nNo confirmed pending Luke Kennard trade or Jaxson Hayes suspension in available reports; Lakers enter at 31-19 (fifth in West).[1]  \nLakers positioned to exploit Warriors' injuries by focusing defense on Green's passing, pressuring guards, and seeking transition opportunities without Curry/Porzi\u0146\u0123is.[1]"
