In a February 1 game against Atlanta, Nembhard scored 26 points as the Pacers won 129-124.[1] However, the search results do not provide comprehensive backcourt scoring statistics across the season or specific data on how scoring has declined compared to when Haliburton was active.\n\n**Three-Game Losing Streak Context:** The Pacers entered a matchup against Toronto after losing three consecutive games.[1] The search results do not provide detailed lineup combination analysis or specific reasons correlating the losing streak to particular backcourt configurations.\n\n## Toronto Raptors - Quickley Status and Scoring\n\n**Quickley Information Not Available:** The search results provided do not contain any information about Toronto Raptors guard Quickley, his injury status, minutes restrictions, or his 19.4 PPG average.

Additional sources focusing on season-long backcourt statistics and current Raptors roster status would be necessary to fully address your research questions."
