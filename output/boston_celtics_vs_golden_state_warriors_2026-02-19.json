  "search_context": "### Injury Report\n\n**Boston Celtics**\n\n| Player | Status | Injury |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Jayson Tatum | OUT | Right Achilles (Repair)[7] |\n| Neemias Queta | QUESTIONABLE | Left Ankle[3] |\n| Chris Boucher | OUT | Illness[3] |\n\n**Golden State Warriors**\n\n| Player | Status | Injury |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Stephen Curry | OUT | Right Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome[5][7] |\n| Jimmy Butler III | OUT | Right ACL (Surgery)[7] |\n| Seth Curry | OUT | Left Sciatic Nerve (Irritation)[7] |\n| L.J. Cryer | OUT | Hamstring[3] |\n| Kristaps Porzingis | QUESTIONABLE | Left Achilles Soreness[3][5] |\n| Will Richard | QUESTIONABLE | Knee[3] |\n\n### Betting Lines\n\nNo current consensus spread, moneyline odds, or over/under total information available in search results.\n\n### Line Movement\n\nNo line movement data available in search results.\n\n### Recent News\n\nThe Celtics have demonstrated resilience despite Tatum's absence, winning three of their last four games, including a 124-105 victory against the Chicago Bulls at home[2]. The Warriors have a record of 1-1 in their last two games, with a close win over Memphis and a 113-126 defeat against the San Antonio Spurs[2].\n\nStephen Curry did not practice as the Warriors returned to the floor on Wednesday, with Warriors coach Steve Kerr indicating an update would come after Curry's work with the training staff[5]. Kristaps Porzingis, acquired by the Warriors in the Jonathan Kuminga trade, has been upgraded to questionable after practicing and reporting he felt good[5].\n\n### Additional Context\n### Jayson Tatum Injury Status\nJayson Tatum tore his right Achilles tendon in Game 4 of the Boston Celtics' second-round playoff series against the New York Knicks in May 2025[1][2][3][4][5]. As of February 2026, he is 40 weeks into recovery, has started controlled five-on-five scrimmaging with coaches (reported Feb. 8, 2026), and practiced with the G League's Maine Celtics before being recalled[2][3][4][5]. Return timeline remains fluid; he must complete additional rehab phases including full team practices, and no decision has been made on playing this 2025-26 season[1][2][3][4][5]. Celtics hold a 35-19 record (No. 2 in East) without him, led by Jaylen Brown[2][3][5].\n\n**Game context:** Tatum is unavailable for the Celtics @ Warriors game, removing their primary scorer (last season: 26.8 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 6.0 APG, 45.2% FG)[3]. This forces reliance on supporting cast like Brown, Derrick White, and new addition Nikola Vucevic (acquired pre-deadline from Chicago for Anfernee Simons, signaling confidence in Tatum's eventual return but not immediate impact)[4].\n\n### Celtics Offensive Efficiency and Pace Without Tatum\nNo specific stats on Celtics' offensive efficiency (e.g., offensive rating) or pace changes without Tatum available in search results[1][2][3][4][5][6]. Team has stayed competitive at 35-19 without him, exceeding expectations per reports[2][3][4][5].\n\n**Game context:** Lack of granular data limits direct comparison to full-strength offense; Brown's All-Star production has sustained viability, but Tatum's absence (high-usage star) tests depth against Warriors[2][3].\n\n### Warriors' Bench Scoring Depth and Listed Absences\nNo search results confirm injuries or absences for Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, or Seth Curry, nor provide Warriors bench scoring stats or depth analysis[1-6]. No mentions of simultaneous unavailability for these players.\n\n**Game context:** Without data on these specific absences or bench output (e.g., points per game from reserves), unable to assess compensation potential; Curry (not Butler/Seth) is Warriors' primary engine, so any unlisted status would similarly hinge on supporting cast[1-6].\n\n### Player & Team News\nI need to clarify an important discrepancy in your request. The search results show that several players you've listed are not on these rosters for today's game.\n\n**Roster Clarifications:**\n\nThe **Golden State Warriors** roster in today's game does not include Jimmy Butler, Brandin Podziemski, or Jonathan Kuminga in the available player information. The Warriors' expected starting lineup features Pat Spencer (PG), De'Anthony Melton (SG), Moses Moody (SF), Gui Santos (PF), and Draymond Green (C).[6]\n\nThe **Boston Celtics** roster does not include Payton Pritchard or Anfernee Simons in the search results. The Celtics' expected starting lineup features Derrick White (PG), Baylor Scheierman (SG), Jaylen Brown (SF), Sam Hauser (PF), and Neemias Queta (C).[6]\n\n**Available Player-Focused News:**\n\n**Returning Players & Ramp-Ups**\n\n**Kristaps Porzingis** is set to make his Warriors debut against Boston. The former Celtics center is listed as \"questionable\" due to an Achilles injury but indicated he is \"ready to go.\" He has appeared in 17 games this season (12 starts) and is averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks per game.[5] Warriors coach Steve Kerr noted that Porzingis is \"an easy fit\" and provides valuable post-up scoring, particularly against switches.\n\n**Notable Absences**\n\n**Stephen Curry** will miss his sixth consecutive game due to a sore right knee. Kerr stated Wednesday that Curry \"just wasn't where he needed to be\" for return.[5]\n\n**Jayson Tatum** remains out with an Achilles injury for the Celtics.[4]\n\nGiven the discrepancies between your player list and the actual rosters, I recommend verifying your key players against the confirmed lineups above to ensure accurate analysis.",
