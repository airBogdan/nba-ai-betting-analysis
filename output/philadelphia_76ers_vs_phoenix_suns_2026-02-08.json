  "search_context": "### Injury Report\n**Philadelphia 76ers:** Joel Embiid is questionable (right knee soreness/injury management).[1] Paul George is out (suspension).[1][6]\n\n**Phoenix Suns:** Devin Booker is available (right ankle sprain).[2][4] Jalen Green is available (right hamstring injury management, left hip contusion).[2][4] Grayson Allen is out (right knee sprain, out at least through All-Star break).[1][2][4] Isaiah Livers is out (left shoulder sprain, out at least through All-Star break).[2][4]\n\n### Betting Lines\nNo current consensus spread, moneyline odds, or over/under total available in search results.\n\n### Line Movement\nNo information on opening lines or notable moves available in search results.\n\n### Recent News\nThe game occurred on February 7, 2026, with Philadelphia defeating Phoenix 109-103; Suns shot poorly (16% on 25 three-point attempts in first half) despite returns of Devin Booker (20 points) and Jalen Green.[3][5] Joel Embiid scored 33 points and Tyrese Maxey 29 for Philadelphia; Dillon Brooks led Suns with 28 points.[3] Suns lost their second straight game and fell to 1-3 in last four.[3] Grayson Allen and Isaiah Livers were confirmed out after injuries in prior game vs. Golden State Warriors.[2][4]\n\n### Additional Context\n### Suns' Three-Point Shooting Performance\nPhoenix Suns rank among NBA leaders in three-point percentage at **36.8%** this 2025-26 season (52 games), with splits of 42.3% (likely home), 37.2%, 37.1%, and 36.5% across contexts[5]. No season-long data confirms a 16% first-half rate in any specific recent game as a trend; team averages indicate consistent above-league efficiency, making extreme lows potential outliers without multi-game confirmation[1][3][5]. This matters for the game as sustained spacing relies on reverting to season norms against Philadelphia's perimeter defense, which pressures high-volume shooters.\n\n### Grayson Allen's Status and Backcourt Impact\nGrayson Allen has played 35 games (26 starts), averaging 4.0 assists per game with a 2.4 assist-to-turnover ratio, contributing to backcourt depth alongside Devin Booker (41 GP, 6.2 APG) and Collin Gillespie (51 GP, 4.7 APG)[3]. A February 4, 2026, analysis notes Allen's \"down shooting year\" despite career 39+% from three on 3.7+ attempts per game historically, yet he provides \"consistent two-way impact\"[2]. Video context highlights Allen and Gillespie combining for 14 threes in a recent game without top scorers, underscoring their role in offensive spacing[2]. Without Allen, Suns lose a proven sniper (traded for in offseason), reducing backcourt options to Booker, Gillespie, Jordan Goodwin (49 GP, 2.2 APG), and Jamaree Bouyea (26 GP, 1.7 APG), potentially compressing spacing against Philadelphia[2][3].\n\n### Broader Backcourt Depth and Offensive Context\nSuns' backcourt features multiple playmakers: top assistants are Booker (255 total), Gillespie (239), Allen (139), Goodwin (108), and Bouyea (45)[3]. Team totals 24.8 assists per game over 52 games, with opponents at 24.9, showing balanced facilitation[3]. Record stands at 31-21 (2nd in Pacific, tied for 5th seed as of early February 2026), driven by core including Booker (25.4 PPG), Gillespie (10+ points in 40/50 games), and Dillon Brooks[1][2][3]. Missing two key rotation players (implied as Allen and another scorer) tests depth, as recent games without Booker/Brooks relied on Gillespie/Allen for 14 threes total[2]. This depth supports spacing via multi-shooter rotations, critical versus Philadelphia's defense that limits perimeter efficiency."
