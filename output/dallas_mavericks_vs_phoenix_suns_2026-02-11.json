  "search_context": "### Injury Report\n**Dallas Mavericks:** Kyrie Irving is out (left knee injury; surgery in December 2025, return after All-Star break).[1][4] Dereck Lively II is out (right foot surgery; out for rest of season).[1] Klay Thompson is questionable (rest/load management).[1][4] Available players include Cooper Flagg, Daniel Gafford, P.J. Washington, D\u2019Angelo Russell, Dante Exum, Jaden Hardy, Brandon Williams, and Max Christie.[1]\n\n**Phoenix Suns:** Cole Anthony is out (non-injury reasons; away through at least February 11).[1] Grayson Allen is out (knee injury; re-evaluation after All-Star break).[1] Isaiah Livers is out (shoulder injury; re-evaluation after All-Star break).[1] Available players include Devin Booker, Jalen Green, Mark Williams, Dillon Brooks, Royce O\u2019Neale, Nick Richards, Jordan Goodwin, and Collin Gillespie.[1] Official NBA injury report for Phoenix Suns not yet submitted.[3]\n\n### Betting Lines\nNo current consensus spread, moneyline odds, or over/under total available in search results.\n\n### Line Movement\nNo information on opening lines or notable moves available in search results.\n\n### Recent News\nPhoenix Suns defeated Dallas Mavericks 120-111 in their most recent matchup (prior game).[2][5] Naji Marshall led Dallas with 31 points, Cooper Flagg added 27; Dillon Brooks scored 23 for Phoenix, Devin Booker 19.[2] Khris Middleton debuted for Dallas off the bench with 13 points.[2] Jalen Green discussed injury frustration post-game.[5] Suns showing potential All-Star break fatigue in recent play.[6]\n\n### Additional Context\n### Suns Defensive Efficiency (Last 10 Games and Season Context)\nPhoenix Suns rank **8th** in NBA defensive efficiency (1.094) for the 2025-26 season, with a season defensive rating of **113.4**.[3][5] Pre-February (pre-All-Star break), Suns had a **111.8 defensive rating (5th)** and +2.9 net rating (10th); in February, it dropped to a **-3.0 net rating (19th)**, indicating post-break fatigue impacting defense.[4] Grayson Allen has a **115.2 defensive rating** in 34 games (over 30 MPG), ranking 8th among shooting guards despite injuries; he is noted as missing time with nagging injuries this season.[1] Mark Williams has a **109.6 defensive rating**.[1] This matters for the game as recent defensive decline and Allen's injury history could weaken wing perimeter defense against Dallas's spacing.\n\n### Suns Three-Point Shooting Consistency (Last 10 Games)\nNo specific data available on Suns' three-point shooting percentages or makes/attempts over the last 10 games from provided sources. Grayson Allen's three-point percentage is \"drastically down\" this season despite prior sniper reputation, while maintaining two-way impact.[1] Season-level opponent top-10 defense stats show Suns players like Devin Booker (28.3 PPG per 40 min in 11 such games) and Dillon Brooks performing efficiently, suggesting perimeter scoring resilience.[2] This context highlights potential offensive consistency but lacks direct 3PT metrics for recent games.\n\n### Injury Status: Grayson Allen and Rory Livers\n**Grayson Allen**: Missed time this season due to several nagging injuries; has played 34 games at over 30 MPG with strong defensive rating (115.2, 8th at SG).[1] No specific update on current status for Feb. 11 game. Matters as his absence weakens Suns' wing defense (top-8 SG defender), creating vulnerabilities to Mavericks' offense.[1]  \n**Rory Livers**: No mentions or injury data in sources. (Note: Query references \"Livers,\" but no confirming info found.)\n\n### Klay Thompson Status for Dallas\nNo information available on Klay Thompson's status for the Feb. 11, 2026, Mavericks @ Suns game.\n\n### Kyrie Irving Status and Dallas Backcourt Depth\nNo direct data on Kyrie Irving's status or Dallas backcourt depth without him. Mavericks rank **13th** in defensive efficiency (1.105 season), with recent \"Last 3\" at 1.205 (poorer form).[5] Suns' perimeter players like Devin Booker and Dillon Brooks excel vs. top-10 defenses (28.3 and 27.5 PPG per 40 min), which could test Dallas's backcourt pace.[2] Mavericks' 8-game losing streak unconfirmed in sources.\n\n### Khris Middleton Addition to Mavericks\nNo mentions of Khris Middleton joining or impacting Dallas's offensive spacing.\n\n### Player & Team News\n# Player-Focused Game Report: Mavericks @ Suns\n\nThe Phoenix Suns defeated the Dallas Mavericks 120-111 on February 10, 2026.[2] Here's the player-focused narrative from the game:\n\n## Player Form & Streaks\n\n**Naji Marshall** led Dallas with **31 points**, showcasing strong offensive performance despite the loss.[1] **Cooper Flagg**, the rookie, contributed **27 points** in a notable effort to spark a late-game comeback.[1] For Phoenix, **Dillon Brooks** scored **23 points** while **Devin Booker** added **19 points**, with Booker delivering crucial late-game plays to seal the victory.[2]\n\nThe Mavericks mounted a furious fourth-quarter comeback attempt, cutting a 31-point deficit down to just six points (115-109) with 2:09 remaining before the Suns closed out the game.[4] Booker made a mid-range jumper with 1:50 left and a pullup jumper to cap the scoring and end Dallas' comeback bid.[4]\n\n## Returning Players & Ramp-Ups\n\n**Khris Middleton** made his season debut for Dallas off the bench, contributing **13 points** in limited action.[1] This marks his initial appearance after joining the team, suggesting he may still be ramping up to full availability.\n\n## Trade & Roster Buzz\n\nKhris Middleton's recent acquisition by the Mavericks represents a significant roster addition, with his season debut occurring during this losing stretch for Dallas.[1]\n\n## Matchup Context\n\nThe Suns dominated early, building a **31-point lead** (61-30) before the Mavericks' late-game heroics made it competitive.[4] The Mavericks' loss extended their **losing streak to eight consecutive games**, their longest since 2016.[2]",
