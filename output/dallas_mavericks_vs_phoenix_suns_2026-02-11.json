The streak began after a home win over Golden State on January 22, 2026[1][2][5]. Prior to the Phoenix game, Dallas was 19-33 overall (12th in Western Conference), 5-18 on the road, and had lost 7 straight coming off a 138-125 defeat to San Antonio Spurs[2][3][4].\n\n### Injury Status and Key Absences\n- **Kyrie Irving**: Out (knee surgery), listed as unavailable for the February 10 game against Phoenix[3][4].\n- **Dereck Lively II**: Out for the season (foot surgery), impacting Dallas's frontcourt depth throughout the streak[3][4].\n- **Khris Middleton**: Day-to-day (not injury related) as of pre-game report for February 10[3].\n- **Klay Thompson**: Questionable (rest) entering the February 10 game[4].\nThese absences force reliance on players like Naji Marshall (31 points) and Cooper Flagg (27 points) in the loss to Phoenix, highlighting thin guard and center rotations against Phoenix's scoring options like Dillon Brooks (23 points) and Devin Booker (19 points)[1][2][3][4][5].\n\n### Lineup and Performance in Recent Stretch (Last 10 Games)\nDallas went 3-7 in their last 10 games before the streak-extending loss, averaging:\n- 116.6 points scored, 46.9 rebounds, 25.4 assists, 7.2 steals, 5.0 blocks, 46.4% FG[3].\n- Opponents averaged 118.3 points, outscoring Dallas by 1.7 points per game[3].\nSeasonally, Dallas allows 117.2 points per game (outscored by 3.0 points overall), shoots 47.0% FG (0.2% above Phoenix opponents' average), but ranks 4th-worst in offensive rating and last in NBA opponent points in paint during streak period[3][4]. Without Irving and Lively, lineups featured Flagg (22.0 points, 6.6 rebounds last 10 games) and P.J. Washington (14.1 points, 7.1 rebounds)[3], correlating with defensive struggles (e.g., Phoenix led by 31 points at halftime in Feb 10 game)[2].\n\n### Offensive/Defensive Efficiency Context vs. Phoenix\nPhoenix shot 46.0% FG season-to-date (0.5% below Dallas opponents' average), won 4 of last 5 vs. Dallas including 123-114 on Nov 13, 2025[3][4]. In last 10, Phoenix averaged 109.0 points scored (44.8% FG), opponents 109.4 points (8th in defensive rating), giving them edge in paint protection and rebounding needs against Dallas's depleted interior[3][4]. Dallas's depth chart limitations without Irving/Lively expose them to Phoenix's home strength (17-9 record pre-game, now tested post-win), as Suns exploit slower rotations[3][4]. In Feb 10 game, Dallas mounted late comeback (cut deficit to 6 points) but Suns closed out[2].",
