  "search_context": "### Injury Report\n**Detroit Pistons:**\n- Jalen Duren: Out (League Suspension)[2][4][6][9]\n- Isaiah Stewart: Out (League Suspension)[2][4][6][9]\n- Bobi Klintman: Out (G League - On Assignment)[2][6]\n- Wendell Moore Jr.: Out (G League - Two-Way)[2][6]\n- Ronald Holland II: Questionable (Personal)[4]\n\n**New York Knicks:**\n- OG Anunoby: Questionable (Injury/Illness - Right Toe; Toenail Avulsion)[1][3][5][6]\n- Miles McBride: Out (Injury/Illness - Pelvic; Core Muscle Surgery)[1][2][4][6]\n- Pacome Dadiet: Questionable (G League - On Assignment)[2][6]\n\n### Betting Lines\nKnicks -4.5 spread favorites; Knicks -180 moneyline; specific over/under total unavailable[5].\n\n### Line Movement\nNo information on opening lines or notable moves.\n\n### Recent News\nPistons on three-game winning streak, including 118-80 win over Knicks on February 6; top Eastern Conference team with potent offense led by Cade Cunningham (25 points, 9 assists, 5 rebounds per game)[2]. Knicks recent 138-89 win over 76ers on February 11, but overtime loss to Indiana prior; lost both prior games to Pistons by significant margins[2]. Jeremy Sochan newest Knick[8]. Anunoby expected to play despite questionable status per insider reports[3][5].\n\n### Additional Context\n# NBA Betting Analysis: Detroit Pistons @ New York Knicks\n\n## Suspension Status and Timeline\n\n**Jalen Duren** is suspended for **two games** for initiating the altercation and fighting in Monday's game against Charlotte[2]. **Isaiah Stewart** is suspended for **seven games** based in part on his repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts[2]. Both suspensions took effect immediately on Wednesday, meaning both players missed the Pistons' game against Toronto on Wednesday night[2].\n\nThe Knicks matchup is scheduled for after the All-Star break[1]. Based on Stewart's suspension timeline, he will be eligible to return on March 3 against the Cavaliers[1], which means he will miss the upcoming Knicks game. Duren's two-game suspension means he will miss Wednesday's Raptors game and one additional game, making his availability for the Knicks matchup dependent on the exact game sequence.\n\n**Note:** Duren will still be able to participate in the NBA All-Star Game despite the suspension[3].\n\n## Impact on Interior Defense and Rebounding\n\nThe search results do not contain specific statistics on the Pistons' defensive rebounding performance, interior presence metrics, or how Duren and Stewart's individual contributions affect these areas. Additionally, the search results do not include data on the Knicks' offensive rebounding advantage in prior matchups against Detroit or comparative rebounding statistics between the teams.\n\n## Available Context\n\nThe Pistons are in first place in the Eastern Conference[3]. The team will need to rely on **Paul Reed and two-way center Isaac Jones** to fill the void left by the suspensions[1]. Detroit defeated Charlotte 110-104 in the game that triggered the suspensions[2], and the Pistons won 113-95 against Toronto on Wednesday night[3].\n\nTo complete the betting analysis as requested, you would need additional data sources that provide:\n- Defensive rebounding rates and interior defense metrics for both teams\n- Offensive rebounding statistics from prior Pistons-Knicks matchups\n- Individual rebounding and defensive contributions from Duren and Stewart\n\n### Player & Team News\n### Player Form & Streaks\n**Cade Cunningham** recently scored 28 points with seven rebounds and nine assists in Detroit's win over Toronto.[2]\n\n### Rotation & Role Changes\nDetroit lacks interior depth without Jalen Duren due to suspension, with **Paul Reed** stepping up for 22 points in the last game.[2]\n\n### Returning Players & Ramp-Ups\nNo relevant information available.\n\n### Trade & Roster Buzz\nThe Knicks feature potential integration of **Jeremy Sochan** into the lineup for added versatility.[2]\n\n### Matchup Storylines\nDetroit has dominated New York this season, winning by 31 points in early January and 38 points on February 6, when the Knicks shot 35.4% from the field and 8-of-33 from three.[4]\n\n### Rest & Load Management\nNo relevant information available.",
