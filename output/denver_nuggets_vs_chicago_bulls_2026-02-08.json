He played 31 minutes, scoring 28 points (11-18 FG, 4-9 3PT), 3 rebounds, and 11 assists[1][2][3]. Head coach David Adelman stated post-game he is \"confident [Murray] will be okay\" after further evaluation (reported February 7-8, 2026)[1][2]. No specific severity or return timeline confirmed; he is considered questionable for next game vs. Cavaliers (Monday, February 9)[2]. This matters as Murray averages 25+ points, 4+ rebounds, 7.5 assists on career-best efficiency (48.6% FG, 43.2% 3PT) in 47 games, forming Denver's core offense with Jokic; any absence amplifies losses of Aaron Gordon (hamstring, re-eval 4-6 weeks from Jan 29) and Peyton Watson (Grade 2 hamstring, out at least 4 weeks from Feb 6)[1][3][4].\n\n### Nikola Jokic Status\nNo injury concerns for **Nikola Jokic**; he played and made history with a triple-double in Saturday's win vs. Bulls (specific stats not detailed in reports)[3]. Jokic is Denver's anchor, complementing Murray as the team's top player; his availability is not in question, preserving half of Denver's offensive engine[1].\n\n### Betting Lines and Sharp Money Movement\nSearch results contain **no current betting lines**, odds, or sharp money movement data for Nuggets @ Bulls[1][2][3][4][5][6]. No evidence market has priced in Murray's injury (news from Feb 7-8 game); absence of line info prevents assessing roster impact mismatch.\n\n### Game Context and Roster Impact\nDenver won Saturday's game 136-120 despite Murray's exit (up 15 points at departure), ending a three-game skid, but faces injury-plagued roster with Gordon and Watson out long-term[1][2][3][4][5]. Two home games remain before All-Star break (vs. Cavaliers Monday, Grizzlies Wednesday), offering recovery window if Murray misses time[1][3]. Murray/Jokic duo critical: Murray's health vital amid Jokic's prior knee absence and team's championship reliance on star backcourt[1]."
