You knew that they wouldn't go one-for-20, whatever it was, again from three.\"[6]\n\n### Additional Context\n### Wizards' Backcourt Injuries and Defensive Context\nNo search results confirm D'Angelo Russell, Trae Young, or Jaden Hardy as Washington Wizards players or report their absences for this game or recent matchups[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Wizards' current season predictive rating is -9.0 (NBA rank #30), with home rating -11.7 (#30), indicating overall poor performance that could limit perimeter defense regardless of specific injuries[6]. This matters as it suggests baseline defensive vulnerabilities against Miami's three-point shooting, though no direct data on Wizards' depleted backcourt vs. Heat threes exists in results.\n\n### Recent Matchups: Wizards Defense vs. Heat Three-Point Shooting\nNo specific data on Wizards' defense against Miami's three-point shooting in recent games with a depleted backcourt[1][2][3][7]. Head-to-head since 2023-24 season: Miami leads 6-2 in last 8 meetings[2]. Recent 2025 games: Wizards won 119-118 at Miami (Apr 13), Miami won 120-94 vs Wizards (Mar 31) and date not specified (Mar 3)[7]. Historical H2H (93 games since 2004): Miami won 65, Wizards 28; Miami PPG 104.3, Wizards allowed 104.3 PPG to Miami[1]. Last 5 H2H for each: Miami 2-3 (allowed 123.6 OPP PPG), Wizards 3-2 (115.6 OPP PPG allowed)[1]. Lacks three-point specifics or backcourt injury context, limiting direct analysis for Heat's shooting exploitation.\n\n### Injury Statuses\nNo results detail Miami injuries for Bam Adebayo (probable) or Norman Powell (questionable), nor confirm Washington's \"more clearly unavailable key players\" like named guards[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. Season context shows Miami at 14-15 (Eastern rank ~7th per partial standings[3][5]), Wizards 8-20 (rank 14th[5]). This matters as injury uncertainty could impact Miami's favored status (11.5-point spread noted in query), but no sourced statuses available.\n\n### Current Season Stats and Spread Context\nMiami averages 119.5 PPG (+1.8 margin), Wizards 112.3 PPG (-10.2 margin); Miami effective FG% 53.3%, Wizards 53.0%[6]. Wizards rank last (#30) in home score margin (-11.7), predictive rating (-9.0), and away rating (-8.2)[6]. Game listed as Feb 8, 2026 (Wizards home per context[5][6][7]); odds N/A in results[2]. 11.5-point spread unaddressed directly, but Wizards' poor rankings align with large favorite status for Miami, factoring overall team strength over unconfirmed injuries[6]. H2H ATS win% 48.0%, total over 60.0% historically[1]."
