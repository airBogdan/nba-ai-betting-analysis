  "search_context": "I need to clarify an important issue with your request: **the game you're asking about has already been played**. The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 136-108 on **Tuesday, February 10, 2026**[1][3], which was yesterday relative to today's date (Wednesday, February 11, 2026).\n\nThe search results contain post-game information rather than pre-game analysis. If you're looking for information about a different game today, please clarify which matchup you need researched. \n\nBased on the search results provided, I can confirm that the Spurs' next game is against the **Golden State Warriors on Wednesday at 9:00 PM CDT**[5], which would be today. However, I don't have pre-game data (injury reports, betting lines, or line movement) for that matchup in the current search results.\n\nTo provide you with an accurate pre-game research report, please specify:\n- Which game you need analyzed (Spurs vs. Warriors today, or a different matchup)?\n- Whether you need the report for the already-completed Lakers game for historical reference?\n\n### Additional Context\n### Game Context\nThe referenced game was San Antonio Spurs at Los Angeles Lakers on February 10, 2026, resulting in a 136-108 Spurs win.[1][3][4] Spurs entered with a 36-16 record (first in Southwest Division, top-3 in West) and four straight wins; Lakers were 32-20 (fifth in West).[2] Spurs lead season series 2-1, both wins by double digits.[2] This context matters as it highlights Spurs' roster stability and rebounding/rim protection edge (117.6 PPG, 46.6 RPG) over Lakers (116.0 PPG).[2]\n\n### Injury Status for Spurs @ Lakers (Feb 10 Game)\n**Spurs (Core Available):** Victor Wembanyama (23.9 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.7 BPG), Stephon Castle (20.3 PPG, 7.0 APG; exited early with pelvic contusion/tailbone soreness but X-rays negative), Keldon Johnson (55.2% FG, 38.9% 3PT), Julian Champagnie active.[2][3][4] Out: Lindy Waters III (knee hyperextension, return after Feb 11), David Jones Garcia (ankle surgery, season), Harrison Ingram (two-way G-League).[2][6] Healthy core drove 40 points from Wembanyama in 26 minutes.[4]\n\n**Lakers (Entire Starting Lineup Unavailable):** Out: LeBron James (left foot arthritis), Luka Doncic (left hamstring strain), Austin Reaves (left calf), Marcus Smart (right ankle tweak from prior game, high soreness), Adou Thiero (right knee/MCL), Cole Anthony (not with team), Isaiah Livers (left shoulder).[1][2][5][6] Questionable/game-time: Deandre Ayton (right knee soreness).[1][2][5][6] Rui Hachimura (44.9% 3PT) expected to play.[2] Absences depleted paint stability and scoring, enabling Spurs blowout.[1][2][5]\n\n### Stephon Castle Update Post-Lakers Game (Relevant to Next Matchup)\nCastle ruled out second half of Feb 10 win with pelvic contusion/tailbone impact after hard fall; X-rays negative, self-reported \"I'm good.\"[3][4] Coach expects \"really sore\" tailbone; game-time decision for Feb 11 Spurs @ Warriors (back-to-back, pre-All-Star).[3][4] Matters for pace/lineup as Castle provides 20+ PPG and playmaking in 12 minutes played.[3]\n\n### Betting Line Movement and Sharp Action\nNo specific opening/current lines, movements, or sharp/public money indicators in results. Game outcome (136-108) reflects heavy Spurs favoritism due to Lakers' mass absences vs Spurs' health.[1][2]\n\n### Spurs Pace/Efficiency in Recent Wins (W5 Streak Context)\nSpurs won four straight entering Feb 10, extending to five with 136-108 result; driven by core health (Wembanyama rim protection, Johnson efficiency, Castle assists) and consistency (117.6 PPG, strong rebounding/interior D).[2][4] Feb 10 featured 69-46 halftime lead, 40 Wembanyama points; no explicit pace metrics, but blowout on back-to-back suggests sustainable form from roster depth vs variance.[1][3][4] Lakers short-handed matchup limits outlier assessment.[1][2][5]",
