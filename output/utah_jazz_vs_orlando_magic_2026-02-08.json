This injury occurred on the same day he was returning from a left ankle sprain that had sidelined him for three games[1]. George initially left the floor, briefly returned, then exited again for further evaluation and did not return to the game[1].\n\n**Game Performance (Before Exit):** In 13 minutes of play, George finished with 5 points (1-5 FG, 0-2 3PT, 3-3 FT), 1 rebound, 1 assist, and 1 steal[2].\n\n**Next Opportunity:** George's next chance to play is Monday against Miami[2], meaning he will miss at least one additional game after Saturday's injury.\n\n**Context:** George had been on a 24-minute minutes restriction heading into Saturday's game due to his recent left ankle injury[1]. The back-to-back ankle injuries to opposite ankles represent a significant setback for the Jazz's third-year guard.\n\n## Franz Wagner (Orlando Magic)\n\n**Current Status:** Wagner is **ruled out** and will not play in Saturday's game against Utah[7].\n\n**Injury Details:** Wagner is managing a left high ankle sprain and has missed nine consecutive games as of the pre-game injury report[7].\n\n**Impact on Perimeter Defense:** With Wagner unavailable, Anthony Black and Tristan da Silva are expected to see increased playing time on the perimeter for Orlando[7]."
