  "search_context": "### Injury Report\n**LA Clippers:**\n- Darius Garland (PG): Questionable, toe injury[2][4].\n- Bradley Beal (SG): Out, hip (sidelined extended period, season-ending fractured hip per some reports)[2][4].\n- Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 (SG): Questionable, hamstring[4].\n\n**Houston Rockets:**\n- Jae'Sean Tate (SF): Out, wrist contusion[2].\n- Steven Adams (C): Out, ankle (Grade 3 sprain, season-ending surgery)[2][4].\n- Fred VanVleet (PG): Out, knee (torn ACL, season-ending)[2][4].\n- Tari Eason: Likely out (no specific injury detailed)[8].\n- Dorian Finney-Smith: Likely out (no specific injury detailed)[8].\n\nOfficial NBA injury reports for this game were not yet submitted as of 12:15 PM ET[6][7].\n\n### Betting Lines\nNo current consensus spread, moneyline odds, or over/under total available in search results.\n\n### Line Movement\nNo information on opening lines or notable moves available.\n\n### Recent News\nNo relevant team news from the last 48 hours on roster moves, rotation changes, notable performances, or rest decisions available.\n\n### Additional Context\n### Houston Injury Status and Depth Impacts\nFred VanVleet is **out** with a right knee ACL repair from the offseason, yet to play this season, forcing increased ball-handling on Amen Thompson and younger guards.[1][3][5][6][7]  \nTari Eason is **questionable** (right ankle sprain, as of Jan 18, 2026) or **probably out**, thinning rotation and perimeter options; recent games saw him contribute poised shot-making in a win over OKC.[2][3][5]  \nSteven Adams is **out** for the season (left ankle surgery, late-January), removing a top offensive rebounder and physical paint presence, shifting to committee rebounding.[1][3][5][6]  \nDorian Finney-Smith is **probably out**, further straining lineups amid multiple injuries.[4][5][7]  \nRockets hold a 32-19 record (4th in West), winning 6 of last 9 despite three rotation players out, relying on young core like Thompson, Eason (if available), Durant, Smith Jr., and Sengun.[1][6]  \nThis matters as VanVleet's absence locks Houston into a post-FVV identity with diversified playmaking from inexperienced guards, exposing backup ball-handling.[1]\n\n### Clippers Injury Status and Point Guard Situation\nDarius Garland is **out** (left toe injury management), delaying his Clippers debut after trade from Cleveland; team managing recovery cautiously.[1][3][5][6]  \nBradley Beal is **out** for season (left hip fracture, early November).[1][3][6]  \nProbable Clippers lineup: Bogdan Bogdanovic (PG), Mathurin (SG), Kawhi Leonard (SF), John Collins (PF), Brook Lopez (C); Bennedict Mathurin (17.8 PPG, 43% FG) debuts after Zubac trade.[1][3][6]  \nThis matters as Garland's absence pressures alternative PGs like Bogdanovic/Dunn, but Clippers' defense (Lopez anchoring paint) remains potent even shorthanded.[1]\n\n### Houston Backup Ball-Handling and Perimeter Defense Without Key Players\nWithout VanVleet, Amen Thompson takes primary PG duties in expected lineup, increasing decision-making for young guards; team has adapted via next-man-up mentality but offense ranks 26th over last 15 games.[1][5][6][7]  \nEason's potential absence (questionable/probably out) weakens perimeter defense and wing depth, as he's featured in recent wins; Finney-Smith out adds to thinner lineups.[2][3][4][5]  \nCoach Udoka notes availability shapes responsibility, with resilience shown in 112-106 OKC win sans Adams/VanVleet.[1]  \nThis matters for exploitation: Clippers can target inexperienced handling (e.g., Thompson) and perimeter gaps from Eason/Finney-Smith absences.[1][7]\n\n### Betting Lines and Sharp Money Movement\nNo specific current betting lines or sharp money movements reported in available sources for this February 11, 2026 matchup.[1][3][6]  \nRockets' 32-19 record and #3/#4 seed status (sources vary slightly) persist despite injuries, creating line challenges vs. shorthanded Clippers; recent power rankings drop to 7th after losses.[1][6][7]\n\n### Player & Team News\n### Player Form & Streaks\nAmen Thompson scored 16 points in his return game after missing Saturday's win over Oklahoma City due to illness.[1][3] Kawhi Leonard scored 24 points after posting 41 in the teams' December matchup.[1][3]\n\n### Rotation & Role Changes\nBennedict Mathurin played 26 minutes, scoring 9 points with 7 rebounds, in his first game since being traded from Indiana last week.[1][3]\n\n### Returning Players & Ramp-Ups\nAmen Thompson returned from illness and contributed 16 points in 26 minutes against the Clippers on Tuesday.[1][3]\n\n### Trade & Roster Buzz\nHouston acquired Bennedict Mathurin from Indiana last week; he debuted with 9 points and 7 rebounds in 26 minutes Tuesday.[1][3] Darius Garland, acquired by Houston in the trade that sent James Harden to Cleveland, remains sidelined with a toe injury.[1][3]\n\n### Matchup Storylines\nThis back-to-back rematch follows Houston's 102-95 win over the Clippers on Tuesday, where Kevin Durant scored 26 points and Alperen Sengun added 22 to secure the victory ahead of the All-Star break.[1][3][4] Kawhi Leonard led LA with 24 points after his 41-point outburst in December's Clippers blowout win.[1][3]"
