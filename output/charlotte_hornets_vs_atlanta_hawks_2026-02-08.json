The available data shows Atlanta's season-long rebounding rankings and their performance in the February 7 matchup, but does not isolate performance changes tied to specific roster transactions or their timeframes.\n\n## Impact on Pace and Second-Chance Scoring\n\nCharlotte's **39% offensive rebound rate** in the recent matchup directly translated to second-chance opportunities, while Atlanta's **13.2% offensive rebound rate** limited their ability to generate additional possessions.[7] This rebounding disparity contributed to Charlotte's ability to control game flow and maintain their nine-game winning streak."
