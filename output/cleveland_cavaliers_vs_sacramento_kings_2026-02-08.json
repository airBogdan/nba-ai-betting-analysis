Cavaliers (31-21 record) won nine of last 11, recently beat Clippers; acquired James Harden from Clippers for Darius Garland ahead of trade deadline[1][2][3][4]. De'Andre Hunter recently traded to Kings, injured in Friday game[1][2]. Kings on second night of back-to-back[2].\n\n### Additional Context\n### Cavaliers Injury Status (as of February 7, 2026)\n- **Evan Mobley**: Out (left calf strain, occurred late January; expected return by February 11).[1][2][3][4][6]\n- **Max Strus**: Out (left foot Jones Fracture surgery, early January; expected return by February 19).[1][2][3][4][6]\n- **Dean Wade**: Doubtful/Out/Questionable (left ankle sprain; missed Saturday's game vs. Kings).[1][2][3][4][6]\n- **James Harden**: Questionable (trade pending from Clippers for Darius Garland; not yet officially active, potential debut in Sacramento).[1][3][4][6]\n- **Emanuel Miller**: Out (G League assignment).[1][3][6]\n\nThese absences reduce frontcourt depth (Mobley out, Wade limited) and guard versatility (Strus out), forcing reliance on Donovan Mitchell, Jarrett Allen, and Dennis Schr\u00f6der for minutes, which impacts rotations against Sacramento's depleted roster on back-to-back night two.[1][3]\n\n### Kings Injury Status (as of February 7, 2026; second night of back-to-back)\n- **Keegan Murray**: Out (ankle sprain; 18th consecutive game missed, through All-Star break).[3][4][5]\n- **Domantas Sabonis**: Out (back; second consecutive game).[3][5]\n- **De'Andre Hunter**: Out (left eye iritis; injured Friday vs. Clippers, first game missed as new King).[3][4][5][6]\n- **Zach LaVine**: Out (finger; first miss since January 27).[5]\n- Others out: Zach Edey (left ankle stress reaction), Obi Toppin (right foot stress fracture).[6]\n\nKings lack primary center (Sabonis), key wings (Murray, Hunter, LaVine), thinning interior defense and spacing; expected lineup features Westbrook, LaVine (out), DeRozan, Hunter (out), Maxime Raynaud, exposing mismatches for Cleveland's guards if Harden plays.[3][5]\n\n### Cavaliers Offensive Efficiency and Pace Without Mobley and Strus\nNo specific metrics provided in reports for Cleveland's offensive rating or pace in games without Mobley/Strus; general context notes increased usage for Mitchell (scoring) and Allen (defense/rebounding) due to frontcourt gaps.[1]\n\nAbsence of Mobley (rim protection/offensive spacing) and Strus (3-point shooting) limits half-court efficiency, as team adapts depth chart with Wade (if available) at forward and guards backing Harden/Mitchell.[1][3]\n\n### Impact of James Harden Acquisition on Lineup Construction\nHarden listed as questionable (trade pending); expected starting lineup if active: Harden, Mitchell, ? (possibly Tyus Jones or Schr\u00f6der), Jarrett Allen.[3]\n\nTrade replaces Garland with Harden, creating backcourt overlap (Harden/Mitchell both ball-dominant), potentially challenging pace and half-court creation without Strus's spacing or Mobley's rolls; depth shifts emphasize Allen's defender role until Mobley returns.[1][3][4]\n\nThis setup tests adaptability vs. Kings' injuries (no Sabonis/Murray), but Harden's integration status remains game-time decision, affecting guard-heavy lineups.[1][4][6]"
