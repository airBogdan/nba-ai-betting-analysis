  "search_context": "I cannot provide the pre-game research report you've requested because the game you're asking about has already been played. The Indiana Pacers @ New York Knicks matchup occurred on **February 10, 2026**[1], which was yesterday relative to today's date (February 11, 2026).\n\nThe search results contain injury information and preview details from before that game, but they do not include:\n\n- **Betting Lines**: No current consensus spread, moneyline odds, or over/under totals are provided in the search results.\n- **Line Movement**: No information about opening lines or line movement is available.\n- **Recent News**: The results contain pre-game preview content rather than post-game news or current roster updates.\n\nIf you're looking for information about an upcoming Knicks game, the search results reference a **New York Knicks @ Philadelphia 76ers matchup on February 11, 2026**[7], which would be today. However, the search results do not contain sufficient detail (injury reports, betting lines, or recent news) to construct a comprehensive pre-game report for that matchup either.\n\nTo get the research report you need, please clarify which game you're interested in, and I can search for current information if available.\n\n### Additional Context\n### Knicks' Defensive Efficiency (Last 10 Games)\nKnicks ranked **26th in defensive efficiency** and **29th in opponent three-point percentage** during their 2-9 stretch in January 2025, indicating poor perimeter containment that allowed opponents to exploit spacing[5]. Season-long defensive rating stands at **114.1 (12th in NBA)**, with **113.7** when Jalen Brunson plays (48 games) versus **120.6** without him (5 games), showing reliance on key players for defensive structure[2]. This matters against Pacers' spacing, as elevated opponent 3P% in recent losses highlights vulnerability to three-point volume.\n\n### Knicks' Three-Point Shooting Variance (Last 10 Games)\nNo direct last-10-games 3PT stats available; season 3P% is **37.8% (3rd in NBA)**, with team averaging **39.5 3PA/game** in recent matchup analysis[1][2]. January's 29th-ranked opponent 3P% defense suggests defensive lapses amplified shooting variance, rather than isolated offensive issues[5]. Relevant for Pacers game, as Knicks' high 3PT rate (**43.6%** possessions) could rebound but exposes them if perimeter D falters.\n\n### Impact of Injuries (McBride and Shamet)\nNo specific status or impact data for Miles McBride or Landry Shamet in provided results; general Knicks bench stats show **7.3 steals/play** season average, led by OG Anunoby at **1.7 SPG**[1][3]. Season defensive rating worsens without Brunson (**120.6**), implying bench absences compound perimeter issues by reducing steals (**7.2 SPG without vs. 8.0 with**) and turnovers forced[2]. This affects containing Indiana's spacing, as weaker bench perimeter D (e.g., lower steals/turnovers) limits disruption of drives and kick-outs.\n\n### Knicks Loss Streak Context\n2-9 record in January tied to **26th-ranked def efficiency**, reflecting sustainable perimeter weaknesses over variance, not just opponent strength[5]. Current record **34-19 (2nd East)** as of Feb 10, 2026, with **+5.6 net rating (4th)**, but recent defensive drop matters versus Pacers' potential despite poor record[2]. Pacers not directly compared; Knicks def rebound % (**76.3%**) strong but opp 3PT points (**41.8/game** in sample) vulnerable[1].\n\n### Player & Team News\n### Player Form & Streaks\nPascal Siakam scored a team-high 30 points with 6 rebounds and 4 assists in the Pacers' win over the Knicks on February 10.[1] Jalen Brunson tallied 40 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds, including a game-tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds left in regulation.[1][2][3] Andrew Nembhard recorded 24 points, 10 assists, and 4 rebounds.[1]\n\n### Rotation & Role Changes\nKobe Brown, recently acquired by the Pacers from the Clippers, hit a three-pointer off a kickout from Nembhard.[2] Shepard provided 8 points in 8 minutes off the Knicks' bench.[2][3] Alvarado dished his fifth assist and hit a bank shot with a foul.[2][3]\n\n### Matchup Storylines\nNembhard chased Brunson defensively during key mid-range sequences, with Brunson pushing back with behind-the-back moves and finishes.[2][3] Aaron Nesmith (N Smith) went at Mikal Bridges on the baseline, drawing contact before hitting a jumper; Bridges later hit both free throws after a lob with his long arms in front.[2][3][1] Jackson guarded Brunson late, contributing to Knicks fatigue.[2][3] Towns fouled out after an offensive foul.[3]"
