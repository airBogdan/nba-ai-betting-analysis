# NBA Betting Strategy

## Core Principles
- Only bet when there's a clear statistical or situational edge
- Prioritize moneyline bets with identifiable advantages
- Never chase losses or force bets on weak slates

## Confidence Guidelines
- **High confidence (2 units)**: Multiple strong edges align
- **Medium confidence (1 unit)**: Single strong edge with manageable risk
- **Low confidence (0.5 units)**: Slight edge, worth small position

## Key Factors to Weight
- Home/away performance differential
- Rest advantage (2+ days vs back-to-back)
- Recent form (last 10 games)
- Head-to-head patterns
- Key player availability
- **Net rating differential (prioritize 10+ point edges)** - ratings_edge bets are 7-1 (87.5%)

## What to Avoid
- Teams on long road trips
- Back-to-back situations against rested opponents
- Overvaluing streaks without underlying stats support
- **Laying large spreads (-6.5+) with injury edges against elite organizations** - depth can compensate

## Notes
- Strategy will be updated as betting history accumulates

## Change Log
### 2026-02-09
- **Key Factors to Weight**: Added explicit guidance to prioritize large net rating differentials as a key factor. _ratings_edge bets are 7-1 (87.5%) - our highest-performing edge type with sufficient sample size. Reflections consistently note that large net rating differentials (10+ points) are reliable predictors. Examples: NYK vs WAS (+16 net rating, won by 31 twice), HOU vs IND (+14 net rating, won outright as dog)._
- **What to Avoid**: Added caution against large spreads based on injury edges vs elite teams. _injury_edge bets are 6-4 (60.0%) with 10 bets - notably weaker than ratings_edge. Key loss: BOS (-6.5) at HOU where Celtics won by 21 despite missing stars. Reflection noted 'elite organizations often have next man up cultures that mitigate personnel losses.' Injury edges work better on moneylines than large spreads._
