# NBA Betting Strategy

## Core Principles
- Only bet when there's a clear statistical or situational edge
- Prioritize moneyline bets with identifiable advantages
- Never chase losses or force bets on weak slates

## Confidence Guidelines
- **High confidence (2 units)**: Multiple strong edges align
- **Medium confidence (1 unit)**: Single strong edge with manageable risk
- **Low confidence (0.5 units)**: Slight edge, worth small position

## Key Factors to Weight
- Home/away performance differential
- Rest advantage (2+ days vs back-to-back)
- Recent form (last 10 games)
- Head-to-head patterns
- Key player availability

## What to Avoid
- Teams on long road trips
- Back-to-back situations against rested opponents
- Overvaluing streaks without underlying stats support

## Notes
- Strategy will be updated as betting history accumulates
