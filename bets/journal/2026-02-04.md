## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on three distinct edges: Knicks as heavy favorites against the league's worst team, and two totals bets based on strong H2H patterns - under in the defensive OKC-Orlando matchup and over in the historically high-scoring GSW-PHI series.

### Selected Bets

**New York Knicks @ Washington Wizards** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New York Knicks (high confidence)
- Units: 2.0
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Massive 15+ net rating differential between elite team and conference bottom-feeder. Knicks on 5-game win streak averaging +17.6 margin. Wizards 2-8 L10, 8-16 at home with worst defense in conference (116.9 DRTG). H2H dominance at 6-2 with 9.1 avg margin. This is the clearest mismatch on the slate.

### Skipped Games

- Los Angeles Lakers @ Brooklyn Nets: Lakers moneyline has edge but significant injury concerns (LeBron 57%, Reaves 50% availability) and H2H shows 60% of games decided by 5 or less. Too much variance for confident play.
- Phoenix Suns @ Portland Trail Blazers: Over has merit but Phoenix missing Grayson Allen and coming off 24-point blowout loss creates uncertainty. Suns moneyline depends heavily on odds not provided.
- Orlando Magic @ Oklahoma City Thunder: OKC moneyline tempting with 21-4 home record but already taking under in this game. Avoiding correlated bets.
- Utah Jazz @ Indiana Pacers: Two bad teams with conflicting situational factors (Utah rest advantage vs Indiana home court). Coin flip territory - no clear edge.
- Chicago Bulls @ Milwaukee Bucks: Bulls spread has merit given Bucks dysfunction but Milwaukee's 10-3 H2H dominance and 6-1 home record vs Bulls creates too much uncertainty.
- Atlanta Hawks @ Miami Heat: Over has H2H support but Atlanta's significant injuries (Trae, CJ, Porzingis) could slow pace. Too much uncertainty on scoring output.
- Denver Nuggets @ Detroit Pistons: Detroit moneyline interesting but Denver 4-1 in last 5 H2H and 0-2 at Detroit in recent meetings. Conflicting signals.
- Boston Celtics @ Dallas Mavericks: Boston spread has edge but both teams have injury concerns and high H2H variance (±19.9). Dallas rest advantage partially offsets Boston's quality edge.
