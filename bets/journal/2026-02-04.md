## Pre-Game Analysis

Targeting two clear roster mismatches (Knicks vs tanking Wizards, Jazz vs G-League Pacers roster) and one injury-driven under where ~88 combined PPG is missing from the Warriors-76ers matchup. Avoiding several games that appear to have already been played or have offsetting factors.

### Selected Bets

**New York Knicks @ Washington Wizards** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New York Knicks (high confidence)
- Units: 2.0
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Massive 16-point net rating differential, 7-2 H2H dominance, Knicks on 5-game win streak with dominant margins. Just beat Wizards by 31 two days ago. Despite B2B concerns, talent gap is too large - Wizards are 3-7 L10 and 9-17 at home.

**Utah Jazz @ Indiana Pacers** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Utah Jazz (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Pacers resting entire rotation (Siakam, Haliburton, Nembhard, Mathurin, Nesmith, McConnell all OUT). Jazz have Markkanen (26.6 PPG) and Collier who just had 22-assist game. Jazz won this exact matchup 131-122 yesterday with similar rosters.

**Philadelphia 76ers @ Golden State Warriors** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 224.5 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: injury_impact
- Reasoning: Both teams missing massive offensive firepower - Curry (26.4 PPG), Butler (season), Kuminga for Warriors; Embiid (25.7 PPG), George (suspended) for 76ers. Combined ~88 PPG absent. Recent H2H was 207 total. Role player vs role player matchup should suppress scoring.

### Skipped Games

- Orlando Magic @ Oklahoma City Thunder: Game already completed - Thunder won 128-92
- Los Angeles Lakers @ Brooklyn Nets: Game may have already been played per web search - verify status before betting
- Chicago Bulls @ Milwaukee Bucks: Bucks won 131-115 yesterday with same injury situation - injury edge already proven ineffective in this matchup
- Phoenix Suns @ Portland Trail Blazers: No betting lines available to confirm value, both teams severely depleted creating high variance
- Atlanta Hawks @ Miami Heat: B2B fatigue for both teams, key injuries on both sides, over edge exists but fatigue factor creates uncertainty
- Denver Nuggets @ Detroit Pistons: Both teams on B2B, H2H games extremely close (50% decided by 5 or less), high variance situation
- Boston Celtics @ Dallas Mavericks: Game may have already occurred, severe Boston injuries (Tatum out, Brown doubtful) create too much uncertainty
