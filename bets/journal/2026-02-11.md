## Pre-Game Analysis

Strong slate with three high-conviction moneyline plays based on massive net rating differentials - our best-performing edge type at 90%. Phoenix and San Antonio face severely compromised opponents (Dallas on 8-game skid missing Kyrie, Lakers missing their entire offensive core), while the Knicks' fundamental advantages over Indiana remain despite yesterday's loss.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $63.64**

**Dallas Mavericks @ Phoenix Suns** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Phoenix Suns (high confidence)
- Amount: $22.82
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Multiple edges align: +4.74 net rating differential (our highest-performing edge type at 90%), Suns 17-9 at home vs Dallas 5-16 on road (23.8%), Dallas on 8-game losing streak, Kyrie Irving out for surgery decimates their backcourt. Suns 5-1 in last 6 H2H meetings. This is a clear mismatch.

**San Antonio Spurs @ Los Angeles Lakers** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Amount: $22.82
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Spurs have +7.4 net rating advantage and Lakers are catastrophically injured - missing LeBron, Reaves, Smart (56.3 PPG combined). Spurs just beat this same depleted Lakers team 136-108 yesterday with Wembanyama scoring 40 in 26 minutes. Spurs on 5-game win streak. This is a severe mismatch.

**Indiana Pacers @ New York Knicks** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New York Knicks (medium confidence)
- Amount: $18.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: +12.96 net rating differential is massive. Knicks 21-6 at home (77.8%) vs Pacers league-worst 3-22 on road (12%). Despite yesterday's loss, the fundamental mismatch remains overwhelming. Knicks 9-1 in L10 overall. Slight discount for B2B fatigue and Pacers' confidence from yesterday.

### Skipped Games

- LA Clippers @ Houston Rockets: While Clippers +9.5 shows a 4.6-point edge, both teams are severely depleted and on B2B. Houston's home court dominance (17-6, 73.9%) and +5.55 net rating edge make this a lean rather than a confident play. The spread edge isn't strong enough given the uncertainty.
