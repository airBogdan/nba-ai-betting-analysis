## Pre-Game Analysis

Strong slate with two high-confidence moneyline plays on Spurs (vs G-League Lakers) and Suns (vs collapsing Mavs), plus a medium-confidence spread on Rockets against injury-depleted Clippers. All three leverage our highest-performing edge type (net rating differential) with supporting factors.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $67.72**

**San Antonio Spurs @ Los Angeles Lakers** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Amount: $24.86
- Edge: Catastrophic Lakers injuries against elite Spurs team that dominated identical matchup by 28 yesterday
- Reasoning: Lakers missing entire starting lineup (LeBron, Doncic, Reaves, Smart - 88.9 PPG). Spurs already won 136-108 yesterday against this exact depleted roster. Spurs have +7.4 net rating advantage at full strength, on 5-game win streak with healthy Wembanyama who dropped 40 in 26 minutes yesterday. This is as close to a lock as you'll find.

**Dallas Mavericks @ Phoenix Suns** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Phoenix Suns (high confidence)
- Amount: $24.86
- Edge: Net rating differential + Dallas catastrophic road record + major injuries + 8-game losing streak
- Reasoning: Phoenix +4.74 net rating edge aligns with our highest-performing bet type (90% on ratings_edge). Dallas on 8-game losing streak (longest since 2016), 5-16 on road, missing Kyrie Irving (surgery) and Lively II (season). Phoenix 17-9 at home, 5-1 recent H2H, won by 9 yesterday in same matchup. Multiple strong factors converge.

**LA Clippers @ Houston Rockets** - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets -7.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $18.00
- Edge: Net rating advantage + dominant home court + Clippers backcourt injuries
- Reasoning: Houston +5.8 net rating edge, 17-6 home record (73.9%), 5-2 recent H2H and 4-0 at home vs Clippers. Clippers in backcourt crisis with Beal out for season, Garland out, Bogdanovic questionable. Houston just beat LA 102-95 two days ago. Expected margin of 8 points provides slight edge over -7.5 line.

### Skipped Games

- Indiana Pacers @ New York Knicks: While Knicks have strong net rating edge (+12.96), Pacers just beat them 137-134 two days ago showing they can compete. Both teams depleted and on zero rest. The H2H recency and fatigue factors create too much uncertainty despite the statistical edge.
