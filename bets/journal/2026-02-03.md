## Pre-Game Analysis

Strong slate with two clear ratings-based edges on Minnesota ML and Houston spread, plus a situational under play on the Pelicans-Hornets back-to-back. Passing on the 76ers-Clippers coin flip.

### Selected Bets

**Minnesota Timberwolves @ Memphis Grizzlies** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Minnesota Timberwolves (high confidence)
- Units: 2.0
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Minnesota has a dominant +7.3 net rating advantage, is on a 4-game win streak, and just beat Memphis by 17 points at this same venue 2 days ago. Memphis is in complete freefall with a 5-game losing streak, 2-8 L10 record, and significant injury concerns with Morant and Edey. The Grizzlies' poor 9-15 home record diminishes any home court edge.

**Houston Rockets @ Indiana Pacers** - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets +4.5 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Houston's elite +6.37 net rating vs Indiana's -7.74 creates a 14.1 point differential - one of the largest mismatches on the slate. Indiana's poor 10-16 home record significantly diminishes their home court advantage. Houston is 7-3 in L10 with quality wins while Indiana's recent OKC upset doesn't offset their overall struggles.

**New Orleans Pelicans @ Charlotte Hornets** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 224.5 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: situational_fatigue
- Reasoning: Both teams are on the second game of a back-to-back, creating significant fatigue. H2H history shows these teams average only 215.8 points per game together. Recent scoring trends show -18.6 combined below season averages. The 224.5 line is inflated relative to the expected total of ~218.

### Skipped Games

- Philadelphia 76ers @ LA Clippers: True coin-flip game with no clear edge. Net ratings nearly identical, both teams have ~24% of offense missing to injuries, and LA's back-to-back fatigue roughly offsets Philly's road disadvantage.
