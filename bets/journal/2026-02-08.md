## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on three high-confidence plays with massive injury edges: two unders where combined 70+ PPG is missing from rosters (DEN/CHI and GSW/LAL), plus Cleveland moneyline against a decimated Kings team on an 11-game losing streak. All three leverage our strong 66.7% injury_edge track record.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $43.00**

**Denver Nuggets @ Chicago Bulls** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 235.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $20.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Bulls traded 4 rotation players mid-week (Vucevic, White, Dosunmu, Huerter) creating a completely new lineup with zero chemistry. Denver missing 43+ PPG from Gordon/Watson/Johnson with Jokic questionable. Injury-adjusted projection of 206.9 gives a massive 28+ point edge on the 235.5 line. Both teams on B2B adds fatigue factor.

**Cleveland Cavaliers @ Sacramento Kings** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Cleveland Cavaliers (high confidence)
- Amount: $23.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Cleveland has a massive +12.7 net rating advantage and is 8-2 L10 vs Kings' 0-10 L10 and 11-game losing streak. Sacramento is missing Sabonis, LaVine, Murray, and Hunter - essentially a gutted roster. Even on B2B, Cleveland's superior depth and form should dominate a demoralized Kings team.

### Skipped Games

- Utah Jazz @ Orlando Magic: Strong analysis but no actual betting lines available to confirm edge exists - waiting for lines
- New York Knicks @ Boston Celtics: Under has merit but no actual lines available; spread too volatile with Embiid uncertainty
- Philadelphia 76ers @ Phoenix Suns: B2B fatigue creates under value but edge is moderate (3.5 points) and Embiid status adds uncertainty
- Miami Heat @ Washington Wizards: Under has value but edge is moderate and both teams' injury situations create high variance
- Memphis Grizzlies @ Portland Trail Blazers: Massive under value (177.6 projection) but no actual lines available to confirm edge
- Indiana Pacers @ Toronto Raptors: Moderate edges on spread and under but not strong enough to prioritize over higher-confidence plays
- LA Clippers @ Minnesota Timberwolves: Clippers +8.5 has value after yesterday's blowout but same-day rematch creates unpredictable revenge factor
- Charlotte Hornets @ Atlanta Hawks: Over has H2H support but B2B fatigue and no available lines reduce confidence
- Golden State Warriors @ Los Angeles Lakers: Vetoed: VETO - Reasoning contains factual errors. Jimmy Butler and Kristaps Porzingis are NOT on the Warriors roster. Butler is on the Heat (or recently traded), Porzingis is on the Celtics. This suggests the injury analysis is unreliable. Cannot trust the edge calculation when the player data is fundamentally wrong. Curry injury may be real but the overall analysis is compromised.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 1-1 | Net: +0.0 units**

### Denver Nuggets @ Chicago Bulls - TOTAL
- Pick: under 235.5
- Result: **LOSS** (-2.0u)
- Final: Denver Nuggets 136 @ Chicago Bulls 120
- Actual Total: 256
- Winner: Denver Nuggets
- Reflection: Badly misread the trade deadline situation - new players came in motivated to score and prove value, while defensive assignments were a mess on both sides. The 256 total (20+ over the line) shows we had the direction completely wrong, not just variance.

### Cleveland Cavaliers @ Sacramento Kings - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Cleveland Cavaliers
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Cleveland Cavaliers 132 @ Sacramento Kings 126
- Winner: Cleveland Cavaliers
- Reflection: The ratings edge and injury analysis were spot-on for the win, though Sacramento's 126 points shows even depleted teams can score in today's NBA. Process was solid - would make this bet again.
