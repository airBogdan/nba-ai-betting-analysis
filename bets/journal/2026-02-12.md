## Pre-Game Analysis

Tonight's slate is defined by catastrophic injuries across multiple games. Taking two high-confidence unders where combined 100+ PPG of star production is missing (OKC/MIL and DAL/LAL), plus a medium-confidence spread on Bucks +12.5 where OKC is without their MVP candidate and key rotation players.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $40.00**

**Milwaukee Bucks @ Oklahoma City Thunder** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 214.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $20.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Catastrophic injury situation with SGA (30.9 PPG), Mitchell (14.1 PPG), and Giannis (27.1 PPG) all OUT - that's 72+ PPG of star production missing. Injury-adjusted projection of 194.4 gives a 20-point edge. Both teams on back-to-backs with 4 games in 7 days adding fatigue. Williams and Holmgren also questionable after leaving Phoenix game. Even with replacement scoring, this total is massively inflated.

**Dallas Mavericks @ Los Angeles Lakers** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 232.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $20.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Both teams missing primary scorers - Doncic (32.6 PPG) for Lakers, Flagg (19.7), Irving (out for season), Lively (out), Marshall (14.6 doubtful) for Dallas. Injury-adjusted total of 197.3 vs line of 232.5 = 35+ point edge. Both teams on back-to-backs. Even accounting for variance and some regression, this total is far too high for two depleted rosters.

### Skipped Games

- Dallas Mavericks @ Los Angeles Lakers: Dallas +7.5 spread had medium confidence but the total bet on this game is stronger. With both teams equally depleted and unpredictable effort levels on back-to-backs, the spread edge (3.8 points) is less reliable than the massive total edge (35+ points).
- Portland Trail Blazers @ Utah Jazz: Under 238.5 had only medium confidence with 6.5 point edge. Both teams have high-scoring H2H history (91% over 220) and play at above-average pace. The edge isn't strong enough compared to the other opportunities tonight.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 2-0 | Net: +4.0 units**

### Milwaukee Bucks @ Oklahoma City Thunder - TOTAL
- Pick: under 214.5
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Milwaukee Bucks 110 @ Oklahoma City Thunder 93
- Actual Total: 203
- Winner: Milwaukee Bucks
- Reflection: The injury edge was perfectly identified - 72+ PPG of missing star production resulted in a 203 total, 11.5 points under the line. This was a textbook high-confidence spot where the market couldn't adjust quickly enough to unprecedented injury news.

### Dallas Mavericks @ Los Angeles Lakers - TOTAL
- Pick: under 232.5
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Dallas Mavericks 104 @ Los Angeles Lakers 124
- Actual Total: 228
- Winner: Los Angeles Lakers
- Reflection: The injury edge was valid - actual total of 228 came in under 232.5 despite Lakers scoring 124. The 35+ point projected edge provided enough cushion to absorb variance, validating the high-confidence approach on significant line discrepancies.
