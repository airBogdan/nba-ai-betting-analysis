## Pre-Game Analysis

Heavy injury slate creates clear edges on three games where one team is catastrophically depleted. OKC missing 7 rotation players vs healthy Spurs is the strongest play. Knicks and Rockets both face skeleton crews at home.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $115.00**

**Oklahoma City Thunder @ San Antonio Spurs** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Amount: $50.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: OKC is catastrophically depleted - missing SGA, Holmgren, Williams, Hartenstein, Dort, Caruso, and Mitchell. This is a G-League roster on B2B after losing by 10 to this same Spurs team yesterday. Wembanyama healthy at home is a massive mismatch. Our injury_edge bets are 2-0.

**Denver Nuggets @ New York Knicks** - SPREAD
- Pick: New York Knicks -7.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $35.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Jokic OUT is catastrophic for Denver - losing 27.8 PPG, 10 APG and their entire offensive identity. Combined with Gordon/Watson/Johnson out, Nuggets fielding skeleton crew. Knicks 20-6 at home, 8-game win streak, 4-1 H2H with +13.8 avg margin.

**Boston Celtics @ Houston Rockets** - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets -6.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $30.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Celtics decimated - missing Tatum (out), Brown (doubtful), Hauser, Simons (traded), Boucher. Houston 17-4 at home with 4th-ranked defense facing what amounts to a developmental squad. Clear personnel mismatch.

### Skipped Games

- Memphis Grizzlies @ Sacramento Kings: Both teams severely depleted with injuries on both sides creating too much uncertainty. Under has merit but prefer cleaner injury edges elsewhere.
- Minnesota Timberwolves @ Toronto Raptors: Edwards and Randle questionable status creates significant uncertainty. Conley trade disruption adds volatility. Pass on unclear situation.
- Cleveland Cavaliers @ LA Clippers: Both teams severely depleted in rematch scenario. Too much chaos with Harden personal absence and multiple injuries on both sides.
- New Orleans Pelicans @ Milwaukee Bucks: No betting lines available. Bucks missing Giannis and multiple rotation players on B2B. Cannot evaluate value without lines.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 1-2 | Net: +0.0 units**

### Oklahoma City Thunder @ San Antonio Spurs - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Oklahoma City Thunder 106 @ San Antonio Spurs 116
- Winner: San Antonio Spurs
- Reflection: The injury edge was textbook valid - OKC's depleted roster on a B2B couldn't compete with a healthy Wembanyama at home, losing by exactly 10 again. Our injury_edge bets are now 3-0, confirming this as our most reliable edge type.

### Denver Nuggets @ New York Knicks - SPREAD
- Pick: New York Knicks -7.5
- Result: **LOSS** (-1.0u)
- Final: Denver Nuggets 127 @ New York Knicks 134
- Winner: New York Knicks
- Reflection: The injury edge was real - Knicks won by 7 as expected in a high-scoring game. Lost by the hook (0.5 points) despite correct read on game direction; the 7.5 line was slightly inflated.

### Boston Celtics @ Houston Rockets - SPREAD
- Pick: Houston Rockets -6.5
- Result: **LOSS** (-1.0u)
- Final: Boston Celtics 114 @ Houston Rockets 93
- Winner: Boston Celtics
- Reflection: The injury edge was real but we overestimated its impact - Boston's system and depth players delivered a 21-point road win despite missing their stars. Houston laying big numbers at home has been inconsistent, and we should have recognized that elite organizations often have 'next man up' cultures that mitigate personnel losses.
