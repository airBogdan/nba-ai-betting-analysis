## Pre-Game Analysis

Targeting three medium-confidence plays: Memphis ML against a collapsing Sacramento team, and two totals bets based on strong H2H patterns - under in MIN/TOR and over in CLE/LAC. Avoiding several games with significant B2B and rest disadvantage situations that neutralize quality edges.

### Selected Bets

**Memphis Grizzlies @ Sacramento Kings** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Memphis Grizzlies (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Memphis has a 7.3-point net rating advantage over Sacramento, who is in complete freefall with a 5-game losing streak and 1-9 L10 record. The Kings just lost to Washington (13-36) at home, showing a team that has quit. Sacramento's home record (9-16) provides minimal advantage, and Memphis has won 3 of last 5 H2H meetings.

**Minnesota Timberwolves @ Toronto Raptors** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 224.5 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: h2h_pattern
- Reasoning: H2H history strongly favors low-scoring games with 209.2 average total and 0% of games exceeding 220. Both teams trending down in scoring (-6.8 combined recent), Minnesota's elite defense (109.9 DRtg) travels well, and Toronto is missing key contributors. Moderate combined pace (103.2) limits possessions.

**Cleveland Cavaliers @ LA Clippers** - TOTAL
- Pick: over 228.0 (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: h2h_pattern
- Reasoning: 100% of H2H games exceeded 220 points with an average of 237.8. Both teams shoot significantly better in this matchup - Clippers +13.8% and Cavaliers +20.3% above their season FG averages. Both teams in strong form (7-3 and 8-2 L10) and Cleveland is more careful with the ball vs Clippers.

### Skipped Games

- Boston Celtics @ Houston Rockets: While H2H patterns favor the over, Boston's B2B fatigue and recent scoring trend down (-18.1) creates too much uncertainty. Houston ML tempting but Boston's superior net rating (+7.44 vs +6.33) and road competence limits confidence.
- Denver Nuggets @ New York Knicks: Both teams on B2B creates unpredictability. Knicks have strong H2H and home record, but Denver's elite road record (19-7) and potential Jokic availability makes this too uncertain for confident action.
- Oklahoma City Thunder @ San Antonio Spurs: OKC's massive quality edge is offset by B2B fatigue, 3-day rest disadvantage, and key injuries (Williams, Hartenstein). Situational factors neutralize the net rating advantage - no clear edge.
- New Orleans Pelicans @ Milwaukee Bucks: Milwaukee's 2-8 L10 form and B2B situation against rested Pelicans creates too much risk despite their H2H dominance. Under tempting but high variance in H2H totals makes it unreliable.
