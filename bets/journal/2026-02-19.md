## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on two high-confidence unders where catastrophic injuries create 17-27 point edges (IND/WAS and ATL/PHI), plus a ratings_edge moneyline on Toronto against a collapsing Bulls team. Avoiding spread bets where injury edges face quality opponents per strategy guidance.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $3774828.84**

**Indiana Pacers @ Washington Wizards** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 232.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $1887414.42
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Catastrophic injuries on both sides create massive under edge. Pacers missing Siakam (23.2 PPG) + Haliburton (season-ending). Wizards missing Sarr (16.9 PPG). Combined 40+ PPG missing from normal rotations. Injury-adjusted total of 205.7 vs line of 232.5 = 26.8 point edge. H2H historically lower-scoring with only 26% of games going over 220 at full strength.

**Atlanta Hawks @ Philadelphia 76ers** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 236.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $1887414.42
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: 76ers missing 42.2 PPG (Embiid + George both out). Injury-adjusted total of 218.8 vs line of 236.5 = 17.7 point edge. Even accounting for variance, this is a massive gap. Hawks won both meetings this season but those were high-scoring - tonight's depleted 76ers roster cannot replicate that offensive output.

### Skipped Games

- Orlando Magic @ Sacramento Kings: Under 223.5 has value but Kings' atrocious defense (117.3 DRTG) creates risk Magic could score at will. H2H historically high-scoring (232.5 avg). Prefer cleaner injury-driven unders in IND/WAS and ATL/PHI.
- Denver Nuggets @ LA Clippers: Under 224.5 has 12-point edge but Denver's injuries (Gordon/Watson) are less catastrophic than other games. Spread edge of 2.7 points is marginal. Passing for cleaner plays.
- Detroit Pistons @ New York Knicks: H2H dominance is compelling but Duren/Stewart suspensions remove 27.3 PPG from Pistons interior. Strategy warns against injury edges on spreads vs quality opponents. Knicks 21-7 at home.
- Brooklyn Nets @ Cleveland Cavaliers: Under 225.5 has value but Mobley OUT partially priced in. Cleveland's 126.8 recent PPG and H2H avg of 236.3 create risk. Prefer cleaner injury situations.
- Boston Celtics @ Golden State Warriors: Warriors missing Curry/Butler is massive but spread at -5.5 with my projection of -10 seems too good. Porzingis could debut, and strategy warns against large spreads with injury edges. Under 211.5 only has 3-point edge.
- Houston Rockets @ Charlotte Hornets: Moneyline edge exists but Charlotte beat Houston by 10 just 13 days ago. Charlotte's 9-1 L10 run and intact core (Ball, Miller) create uncertainty despite Bridges suspension.
- Phoenix Suns @ San Antonio Spurs: Spurs spread has value but H2H heavily favors Phoenix (4-1 recent). If Booker plays, Suns have star power to keep it close. Injury status too uncertain at game time.
- Toronto Raptors @ Chicago Bulls: Vetoed: Kelly recommended is $0 for good reason - the math doesn't support this bet. At -199 odds, you need ~66.6% to break even. Claiming 70-72% edge on a 5.0 net rating differential is optimistic. Bulls' losing streak is already priced in. The edge is too thin at this price point. Ratings_edge performs well but not at heavy juice like this.
