## Pre-Game Analysis

Post-ASB slate features massive injury impacts creating clear edges. Targeting Celtics ML vs decimated Warriors, Hawks-76ers under with 17+ point edge, Cavaliers spread with elite net rating differential, and Pacers-Wizards under with both teams severely depleted. Avoiding games with H2H concerns or elite team depth that could mitigate injury edges.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $10.08**

**Atlanta Hawks @ Philadelphia 76ers** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 236.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $7.33
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: 76ers missing Embiid (26.2 PPG) and George (16.0 PPG) - 42.2 combined PPG out. Injury-adjusted total of ~219 is 17+ points below the 236.5 line. Recent 76ers games show scoring struggles (89 and 118 in last two). Massive edge even accounting for H2H variance.

**Indiana Pacers @ Washington Wizards** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 232.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $2.75
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: Both teams severely depleted - Pacers missing Siakam (23.2 PPG), Haliburton, Zubac; Wizards missing Sarr (16.9 PPG) and others. Injury-adjusted total of 205.7 is 26.8 points below the 232.5 line. H2H historically low-scoring (only 26% over 220).

### Skipped Games

- Phoenix Suns @ San Antonio Spurs: Spurs spread and under have edges but H2H history strongly favors Suns (4-1 recent) and Phoenix shoots exceptionally well vs Spurs historically. Brooks suspension is significant but not enough to overcome H2H concerns.
- Houston Rockets @ Charlotte Hornets: Charlotte's 9-1 L10 form and recent H2H win over Houston creates uncertainty. Injury edge exists but spread value is marginal (1.3 points). Prefer cleaner edges elsewhere.
- Denver Nuggets @ LA Clippers: Under has 12+ point edge but both teams have significant injuries creating high variance. Denver ML at 63% is close to fair value. Prefer more definitive edges.
- Detroit Pistons @ New York Knicks: Strategy notes caution on injury-based spread edges vs elite organizations. Pistons are 40-13 with elite depth and 'next man up' culture. Under has edge but Pistons' scoring ability creates uncertainty.
- Toronto Raptors @ Chicago Bulls: Bulls roster in disarray but home court and new player integration creates unpredictability. Raptors ML at 66.5% is fair value but not compelling enough given Bulls' potential bounce-back.
- Orlando Magic @ Sacramento Kings: Under has massive edge (19.5 points) but Kings are actively tanking with no competitive motivation - game flow becomes unpredictable. Magic ML at 75.5% too expensive.
- Boston Celtics @ Golden State Warriors: Vetoed: Kelly recommended is $0, indicating no mathematical edge at -199 odds. The reasoning mentions Butler missing for Warriors, but Butler plays for the Warriors now per the data trust notice - I accept that. However, even with significant injuries, -199 implies 66.5% win probability. The claimed 75%+ true probability would need to overcome heavy juice. With Kelly at 0, the edge doesn't exist at this price point. Veto.
- Brooklyn Nets @ Cleveland Cavaliers: Vetoed: Kelly recommended is $0, meaning no mathematical edge exists at -163 odds despite the ratings differential. Expected margin of 13.8 vs line of 12.5 is only 1.3 points of cushion - too thin given spread variance. The 87.5% ratings_edge win rate is impressive but sample size concerns apply. Heavy juice eliminates the edge. Veto.

### Player Prop Bets

**Total wagered: $15.43**

**Toronto Raptors @ Chicago Bulls** - PLAYER_PROP
- Pick: Jakob Poeltl rebounds over 5.5 (high confidence)
- Amount: $5.76
- Edge: Line set 2+ rebounds below season average against weakened frontcourt
- Reasoning: Poeltl averages 7.7 RPG, a massive 2.2 rebounds above this 5.5 line. The Bulls' frontcourt is depleted post-Vucevic trade, relying on Richards/Yabusele who lack rebounding presence. The 45% implied probability is severely mispriced when his season average suggests 65%+ hit rate. This is the largest statistical edge across all props.

**Phoenix Suns @ San Antonio Spurs** - PLAYER_PROP
- Pick: Victor Wembanyama points over 23.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $4.50
- Edge: Line set below season average with hot recent form
- Reasoning: Wembanyama averages 23.8 PPG season-wide but has been scorching at 26.3 PPG over last 6 games with elite 62.4% TS. Line is set below both his season average and recent form. Phoenix lacks rim protection, and Wemby has dominated weaker interior defenses (40 pts vs LAL, 29 vs DAL). The 29% implied probability significantly undervalues his production.

**Houston Rockets @ Charlotte Hornets** - PLAYER_PROP
- Pick: Alperen Sengün points over 18.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $1.67
- Edge: Season average 1.7 points above line with favorable matchup
- Reasoning: Sengün averages 20.2 PPG, a full 1.7 points above this line. With VanVleet out for the season, he carries increased offensive responsibility. Charlotte lacks interior defense with Diabaté suspended. The 52% implied probability is mispriced when his average clearly exceeds the line by nearly 2 points.

**Orlando Magic @ Sacramento Kings** - PLAYER_PROP
- Pick: DeMar DeRozan points over 16.5 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $3.50
- Edge: Season average 2+ points above line + favorable guard matchup
- Reasoning: DeRozan averages 18.2-18.7 PPG, nearly 2 points above the 16.5 line. The Magic allow the most points to guards league-wide, creating an ideal matchup for his mid-range game. The 29.5% implied probability is significantly underpriced given his consistent scoring output and favorable defensive matchup.
