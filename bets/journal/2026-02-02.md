## Pre-Game Analysis

Three medium-to-low confidence plays targeting home teams with clear venue advantages (Phoenix, NY) and a road favorite with significant net rating edge (Cleveland). Passing on OKC-Denver due to injury uncertainty on both sides creating unpredictable variance.

### Selected Bets

**LA Clippers @ Phoenix Suns**
- Pick: Phoenix Suns (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: Phoenix 17-6 home vs Clippers 9-16 road combined with 6-1 recent H2H dominance
- Reasoning: Phoenix's 17-6 home record against Clippers' dismal 9-16 road record creates a significant venue edge. The 6-1 recent H2H record and +3.5 net rating differential provide strong statistical backing. While Clippers are 8-2 L10, their road struggles and missing ~24% of offense with Jones Jr./Bogdanovic limited tips the balance clearly to Phoenix at home.

**Cleveland Cavaliers @ Portland Trail Blazers**
- Pick: Cleveland Cavaliers (medium confidence)
- Units: 1.0
- Edge: ~5 point net rating differential with Cleveland 7-3 L10 vs Portland on 4-game skid
- Reasoning: Cleveland's nearly 5-point net rating advantage (+2.19 vs -2.58) is substantial. Portland's 4-game losing streak and 0-2 home record vs Cleveland in H2H history provide additional confidence. Cleveland's 4th quarter strength (+2.8 avg in H2H) suggests they close games well. Garland concerns are noted but Mitchell's 28.2 PPG provides reliable scoring.

**Los Angeles Lakers @ New York Knicks**
- Pick: New York Knicks (low confidence)
- Units: 0.5
- Edge: Knicks elite 19-6 home record + Lakers major availability concerns offset concerning H2H history
- Reasoning: Knicks' 19-6 home record and +6.3 net rating differential are compelling, but Lakers' 3-1 H2H record (2-0 at MSG) creates real concern. The deciding factor is Lakers' significant availability issues - LeBron (57% games), Reaves (51%), Vincent (58%) representing 29% offensive impact. Knicks' 5-game win streak with dominant margins (+26 avg) shows current form. Lower confidence due to H2H pattern.

### Skipped Games

- Oklahoma City Thunder @ Denver Nuggets: Too much uncertainty with significant injuries on both sides (Jokic limited, Jalen Williams, Hartenstein). High H2H variance (±23.1 pts std dev) makes outcomes unpredictable. Denver's 7-3 L10 home form offsets OKC's statistical advantages. No clear edge to exploit.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 2-1 | Net: +0.5 units**

### LA Clippers @ Phoenix Suns - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Phoenix Suns
- Result: **LOSS** (-1.0u)
- Final: LA Clippers 117 @ Phoenix Suns 93
- Winner: LA Clippers
- Reflection: The 24-point blowout wasn't variance - we overweighted historical H2H and home/road splits while underweighting the Clippers' surging form. A team going 8-2 in their last 10 with clear momentum deserved more respect than season-long road struggles.

### Cleveland Cavaliers @ Portland Trail Blazers - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Cleveland Cavaliers
- Result: **WIN** (+1.0u)
- Final: Cleveland Cavaliers 130 @ Portland Trail Blazers 111
- Winner: Cleveland Cavaliers
- Reflection: The primary edge was spot-on - Cleveland's superior net rating and Portland's losing streak played out exactly as expected, with the 19-point margin exceeding even our projections. Process was sound; the medium confidence was perhaps too conservative given the clear statistical separation.

### Los Angeles Lakers @ New York Knicks - MONEYLINE
- Pick: New York Knicks
- Result: **WIN** (+0.5u)
- Final: Los Angeles Lakers 100 @ New York Knicks 112
- Winner: New York Knicks
- Reflection: The primary edge held - Knicks' home dominance and Lakers' availability issues proved decisive despite concerning H2H history. The 12-point margin validated our read on the situational factors, and appropriately sizing down due to H2H uncertainty was the right call.
