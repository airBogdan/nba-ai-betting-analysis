## Pre-Game Analysis

Focusing on two high-confidence plays with massive net rating edges and injury advantages: Spurs road favorite against decimated Dallas, and Magic home dominance over depleted Nets. Adding Magic under as independent edge given H2H scoring patterns and B2B fatigue.

### Selected Bets

**Total wagered: $120.00**

**San Antonio Spurs @ Dallas Mavericks** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs (high confidence)
- Amount: $45.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Elite team (35-16) vs struggling team (19-32) with massive injury issues. Spurs have +7.2 net rating edge, just beat Dallas 135-123 two days ago, and Dallas is missing Kyrie Irving, Dereck Lively II, and P.J. Washington. Spurs 16-10 on road vs Dallas 14-16 at home. Multiple strong edges align.

**Brooklyn Nets @ Orlando Magic** - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Orlando Magic (high confidence)
- Amount: $50.00
- Edge: ratings_edge
- Reasoning: Magic 7-0 vs Nets in recent H2H with complete dominance. +8.4 net rating differential, 15-8 home record vs Nets' 7-19 road record. Nets depleted (missing Cam Thomas), 1-9 L10, and just lost by 20 to this same team yesterday. Franz Wagner out but talent gap is massive.

**Brooklyn Nets @ Orlando Magic** - TOTAL
- Pick: under 218.7 (medium confidence)
- Amount: $25.00
- Edge: injury_edge
- Reasoning: H2H average only 211.6 with just 27% of games going over 220. Both teams on B2B fatigue. Nets missing Thomas (15.6 PPG) and other scorers. Yesterday's game totaled 216. Independent edge from the moneyline - Magic can win comfortably while game stays low-scoring.

### Skipped Games

- Charlotte Hornets @ Houston Rockets: Same-day rematch with both teams on B2B and significant injury uncertainty (Durant, Sengun, Bridges all questionable). No betting lines available. Charlotte just won this matchup yesterday.
- Chicago Bulls @ Toronto Raptors: Bulls roster gutted by trades is compelling, but no betting lines available to confirm value. Would need to see actual spread/total lines to act.
- Golden State Warriors @ Phoenix Suns: Unbettable - both teams catastrophically injured (Curry, Butler, Booker, Green, Allen all out/questionable). Same-day rematch with extreme roster uncertainty.
- Philadelphia 76ers @ Los Angeles Lakers: Doncic hamstring injury status unknown, both teams on second game of day, no betting lines available. Too many critical unknowns.
- Washington Wizards @ Detroit Pistons: Detroit revenge spot is appealing but Duren and Harris both questionable after injuries. Washington just proved they can beat this team. Back-to-back fatigue adds variance.
- Utah Jazz @ Atlanta Hawks: Hawks spread has merit but they're only 10-14 at home and just beat Jazz by only 2 yesterday despite all advantages. Both on B2B. Prefer cleaner spots.

## Post-Game Results

**Record: 3-0 | Net: +5.0 units**

### San Antonio Spurs @ Dallas Mavericks - MONEYLINE
- Pick: San Antonio Spurs
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: San Antonio Spurs 135 @ Dallas Mavericks 123
- Winner: San Antonio Spurs
- Reflection: The exact same score as the recent H2H game (135-123) validates our analysis completely. Elite team vs depleted opponent with clear statistical edges is a reliable betting spot.

### Brooklyn Nets @ Orlando Magic - MONEYLINE
- Pick: Orlando Magic
- Result: **WIN** (+2.0u)
- Final: Brooklyn Nets 98 @ Orlando Magic 118
- Winner: Orlando Magic
- Reflection: The 20-point margin matched yesterday's blowout exactly, validating our read on the massive talent gap and situational factors. This was a textbook spot where multiple edges stacked - H2H dominance, home court, back-to-back fatigue, and depleted opponent.

### Brooklyn Nets @ Orlando Magic - TOTAL
- Pick: under 218.7
- Result: **WIN** (+1.0u)
- Final: Brooklyn Nets 98 @ Orlando Magic 118
- Actual Total: 216
- Winner: Orlando Magic
- Reflection: The injury edge and fatigue factors played out exactly as expected - Nets scored just 98 points with their depleted roster, and the 216 total came in comfortably under our 218.7 line. Process was solid with multiple converging factors supporting the under.
