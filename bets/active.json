    "reasoning": "Bulls traded 4 rotation players mid-week (Vucevic, White, Dosunmu, Huerter) creating a completely new lineup with zero chemistry. Denver missing 43+ PPG from Gordon/Watson/Johnson with Jokic questionable. Injury-adjusted projection of 206.9 gives a massive 28+ point edge on the 235.5 line. Both teams on B2B adds fatigue factor.",

Sacramento is missing Sabonis, LaVine, Murray, and Hunter - essentially a gutted roster. Even on B2B, Cleveland's superior depth and form should dominate a demoralized Kings team.",
