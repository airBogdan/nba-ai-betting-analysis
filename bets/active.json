Memphis is in complete freefall with a 5-game losing streak, 2-8 L10 record, and significant injury concerns with Morant and Edey. The Grizzlies' poor 9-15 home record diminishes any home court edge.",

Houston is 7-3 in L10 with quality wins while Indiana's recent OKC upset doesn't offset their overall struggles.",
