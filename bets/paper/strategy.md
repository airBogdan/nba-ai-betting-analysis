# Paper Trading Strategy

## Purpose
Find value in games the primary analyst skips. Track contrarian picks to discover
which skip patterns leave money on the table.

## Approach
- Challenge skip reasoning — look for edges dismissed too quickly
- Focus on games skipped for "no clear edge" — these often have subtle value
- Be honest about confidence — low confidence is fine for paper trading
- Track which skip categories yield the best results

## What to Look For
- Injury uncertainty games where the line overreacted
- "Coin flip" games where one side actually has a lean
- Games skipped due to variance where statistical edges exist
- Sizing vetos where the edge was real but below threshold
