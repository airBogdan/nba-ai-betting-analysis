      "reasoning": "Phoenix's 17-6 home record against Clippers' dismal 9-16 road record creates a significant venue edge. The 6-1 recent H2H record and +3.5 net rating differential provide strong statistical backing. While Clippers are 8-2 L10, their road struggles and missing ~24% of offense with Jones Jr./Bogdanovic limited tips the balance clearly to Phoenix at home.",

      "reflection": "The 24-point blowout wasn't variance - we overweighted historical H2H and home/road splits while underweighting the Clippers' surging form. A team going 8-2 in their last 10 with clear momentum deserved more respect than season-long road struggles."

      "units": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "Cleveland's nearly 5-point net rating advantage (+2.19 vs -2.58) is substantial. Portland's 4-game losing streak and 0-2 home record vs Cleveland in H2H history provide additional confidence. Cleveland's 4th quarter strength (+2.8 avg in H2H) suggests they close games well. Garland concerns are noted but Mitchell's 28.2 PPG provides reliable scoring.",

      "reflection": "The primary edge was spot-on - Cleveland's superior net rating and Portland's losing streak played out exactly as expected, with the 19-point margin exceeding even our projections. Process was sound; the medium confidence was perhaps too conservative given the clear statistical separation."
